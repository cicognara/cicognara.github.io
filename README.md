# Cicognara Project Website (cicognara.org)

## Development 

All pull requests should be merged to the `development` branch. 

Run `gulp serve` to have the site working locally. It will auto-reload/inject changes on the browser.

To deploy changes:

1. Make sure you have the latest `development` branch on your machine
2. Run `gulp deploy` to copy files in `dist/` to the `master` branch
